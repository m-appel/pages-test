This is the accompanying repository for the PAM 2024 paper "Following the Data
Trail: An Analysis of IXP Dependencies". Use the three buttons above to access:

1. Data to reproduce the plots and analysis from the paper.
1. Weekly updated archive data (in form of CSV files) for bulk data downloads.
1. An API that provides more fine-grained access to the weekly data.

## Data Format (Archive)

The table below shows a data snippet (from the archive data) highlighting all
columns and data variations.


|   id    |        timebin         |   hege   | af | nbsamples | origin_type | origin_name | dependency_type | dependency_name |
|---------|------------------------|----------|----|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1608913 | 2024-01-29 00:00:00+00 |     0.76 |  4 |        31 | AS          |        2501 | AS              | 2497            |
| 1486945 | 2024-01-29 00:00:00+00 | 0.102125 |  4 |      1112 | AS          |        9498 | IX              | 31              |
| 1464692 | 2024-01-29 00:00:00+00 | 0.109375 |  4 |       158 | AS          |       45232 | MB              | 31;9498         |
| 1436188 | 2024-01-29 00:00:00+00 | 0.152929 |  4 |      1112 | AS          |        7713 | IP              | 80.81.193.22    |

- **id**: A running database identifier which can be ignored.
- **timebin**: The timestamp at which the data was produced. Data is produced
  every week at midnight UTC from Sunday to Monday. See below for more
  information.
- **hege**: The hegemony score. **Warning:** We include scores below 0.1 in this
  data, i.e., not all entries are dependencies as defined in the paper.
- **af**: The IP address family of the result. Always 4 (IPv4) for now.
- **nbsamples**: The number of samples (in terms of unique source probe ASes) on
  which the data is based. We only include scores where nbsamples is â‰¥ 10.
- **origin_type**: The type of the origin (called "dependent" in the paper).
  This is the *target AS* of the traceroute, the term "origin" is used for
  consistency with the original AS Hegemony format (which stems from BGP). The
  origin type is mostly "AS", although there are a few exceptions that are a
  side effect of the data production pipeline.
- **origin_name**: The AS number of the origin (if origin_type is "AS").
- **dependency_type**: The type of the dependency (on which origin *depends*).
  The value of this field defines how dependency_name should be interpreted.
  - **AS**: AS number
  - **IX**: A PeeringDB IX id, e.g., [31 for DE-CIX
    Frankfurt](https://www.peeringdb.com/ix/31)
  - **MB**: An IXP member in the format `ix_id;asn`, e.g., `31;9498` refers to
    the DE-CIX Frankfurt member AS9498
  - **IP**: An interface IP of a peering LAN router
- **dependency_name**: See above.

### Working with the data

Below are some examples (based on [Python's pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) syntax):

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('ihr_tr_hegemony_2024-01-29.csv')
# Get all dependents (as defined in the paper) of AS2497.
df[(df.hege >= 0.1) & (df.dependency_type == 'AS') & (df.dependency_name == '2497')]
# Get all ASes depending on some IXP.
df[(df.hege >= 0.1) & (df.dependency_type == 'IX')]
# Get the Hegemony score (if available) between AS2501 and AS2497.
df[(df.origin_type == 'AS') & (df.origin_name == '2501') & (df.dependency_type == 'AS') & (df.dependency_name == '2497')]
```

## Data Format (API)

The API has almost the same format as the archive files. Scroll to the
[tr_hegemony](https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/en-us/api) section of the API page for
a description of the available parameters. Due to the way the internal database
is designed, there are additional "af" parameters, origin_af and dependency_af,
which can be ignored for now (they are always 4).

### Working with the API

Here are the same examples as above, but retrieved from the API:
- [Get all dependents (as defined in the paper) of
  AS2497.](https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/api/tr_hegemony/?timebin=2024-01-29T00%3A00&dependency_name=2497&dependency_type=AS&hege__gte=0.1)
- [Get all ASes depending on some
  IXP.](https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/api/tr_hegemony/?timebin=2024-01-29T00%3A00&dependency_type=IX&hege__gte=0.1)
- [Get the Hegemony score (if available) between AS2501 and
  AS2497.](https://ihr.iijlab.net/ihr/api/tr_hegemony/?timebin=2024-01-29T00%3A00&origin_name=2501&dependency_name=2497&origin_type=AS&dependency_type=AS)

## Data Production Interval

We produce data once a week at midnight UTC from Sunday to Monday. This means
the only available timebins are always ending on `T00:00`. Since we only include
RIPE Atlas data for now (due to ease of access), the results are based on **four
weeks** of traceroute data (filtered by a list of probe ASes, which is updated
weekly, as described in the paper).

Therefore, data with in timebin `2024-01-29T00:00` is based on traceroute
results from `2024-01-01T00:00` to `2024-01-29T00:00`.
